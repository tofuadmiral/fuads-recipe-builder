    "output": """
      Based on the ingredients you have (eggs, spinach, rice) and your budget of $8, I suggest making a Spinach and Egg Fried Rice. This dish is simple, nutritious, and budget-friendly. Here’s how to prepare it:

      **Spinach and Egg Fried Rice Recipe**

      **Ingredients:**
      - 2 cups cooked rice (leftover rice works great)
      - 2 eggs
      - 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped
      - 2 tablespoons soy sauce (optional)
      - 1 tablespoon cooking oil (vegetable or olive oil)
      - 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
      - Salt and pepper to taste

      **Instructions:**
      1. **Prepare the Rice**: If you don’t have leftover rice, cook 1 cup of dry rice according to package instructions (this will yield about 2 cups cooked).
      2. **Cook the Spinach**: In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic (if using) and sauté for 30 seconds. Add chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes.
      3. **Scramble the Eggs**: Push the spinach to one side of the skillet. Crack the eggs into the skillet and scramble them until fully cooked, mixing them with the spinach.
      4. **Combine**: Add the cooked rice to the skillet. Stir everything together, breaking up any clumps of rice. Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently until heated through.
      5. **Serve**: Serve hot, garnished with additional soy sauce or sesame seeds if desired.

      **Additional Groceries Needed:**
      - Soy sauce (if you don't already have it): ~$1
      - Garlic (if you don't already have it): ~$0.50

      **Estimated Total Cost:** $1.50 (additional groceries) + $0 (existing ingredients) = $1.50, well within the $8 budget.

      **Where to Buy:**
      You can find these ingredients at local grocery stores such as:
      - Trader Joe's: Known for competitive prices on fresh produce and pantry staples.
      - Walmart: Often has low prices on rice, eggs, and spinach.
      - Key Food or ShopRite: Local supermarkets that typically have fresh produce and staple groceries at reasonable prices.

      **Imagined Completed Dish:**
      The completed dish will be a colorful stir-fry, with vibrant green spinach mixed throughout the fluffy rice and speckled with golden scrambled eggs. It will have a lovely sheen from the oil and soy sauce, and the garlic will add a wonderful aroma. The plate can be garnished with sesame seeds or chopped scallions for an extra touch.

      Enjoy your delicious and budget-friendly dinner!
